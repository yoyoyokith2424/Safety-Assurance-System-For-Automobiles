# Safety-Assurance-System-For-Automobiles
Safety Assurance System for monitoring and controlling vehicle functions. It uses sensors, microcontrollers, and modules to manage engine ignition unit, headlights, and power parameters. The system detects and alerts theft, parasitic drainage, and provides real-time data analysis and control, ensuring safe and efficient vehicle operation.

# Abstract

The Safety Assurance System for Automobiles is an innovative project that aims to revolutionize the safety features of automobiles by implementing advanced technologies and intelligent control mechanisms. The system addresses common safety concerns encountered during everyday vehicle operation, with the primary objective of reducing the risk of accidents and enhancing overall safety for drivers and passengers.

## Features

The Safety Assurance System focuses on several key areas of concern:

1. Battery Drainage Prevention: Constantly monitors the battery voltage and detects abnormal drainage patterns to prevent unexpected vehicle breakdowns and ensure uninterrupted vehicle operation.

2. Headlight Failure Detection and Response: Utilizes sophisticated sensor mechanisms to detect headlight malfunctions. the system automatically activates an emergency headlight to ensure optimal visibility and driver safety in critical situations.

3. Theft Identification and Alert System: Incorporates advanced theft identification and alert system using Arduino-based technologies and isolated terminals. Notifies the vehicle owner and relevant authorities of unauthorized access attempts.

## How It Works

The Safety Assurance System employs Arduino-based relay systems, isolated terminals, and intelligent algorithms to provide proactive safety measures for vehicles. The system constantly monitors various parameters, such as battery voltage and headlight functionality, and responds accordingly to mitigate and notifiy any potential risks and help provide uninterrupted journey to the passengers.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/safety-assurance-system-for-automobiles.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies ans libraries.
3. Connect the required hardware components as per the provided circuit diagram.
4. Upload the code to the Arduino UNO microcontroller through serial communication.
5. Configure any additional settings as needed.

## Operations

1. Power on the system.
2. The system will automatically monitor and respond to battery drainage, headlight failures, theft attempts, and in-turn send appropriate notifications to the Serial Bluetooth app through the bluetooth connection.
3. Monitor the system's alerts and notifications for any issues or abnormal situations.
4. Take necessary actions based on the system's recommendations and alerts.
